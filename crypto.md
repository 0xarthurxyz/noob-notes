## Incomplete notes (by day)

### Feb 13, 2022

{{< tweet 1492910975011463170 >}}

The following is a brilliant though piece (IMO) by [Ian Bogost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bogost) (media/design/technology guru) in the Atlantic: ‚Äú[The Internet Is Just Investment Banking Now](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/02/future-internet-blockchain-investment-banking/621480/)‚Äù

tldr:
- web3 might be the *securitisation* stage of the internet (where web1/web2 were the ‚Äúmarketisation‚Äù and ‚Äúmonetisation‚Äù stages)
here *securitisation* is understood (broadly) as the practice of commercialising the proxies for things, rather than the things themselves (e.g. a financial proxy for oil, instead of physical oil barrels themselves)
- importantly ‚Äúsecurities have less to do with what they are [intrinsically], than what they might be worth‚Äù
learning from the history of financial securitisation, we might expect things to only get weirder from here :smile:
- ‚ÄúWeb3 as securitisation‚Äù is an interesting mental model, because it helps separate the value of the underlying things from the value of their proxies.
